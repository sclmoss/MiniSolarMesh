## 📡 Using the Mesh Network Features

MiniSolarMesh nodes communicate with each other wirelessly using LORA. This allows your devices to cover a large area by passing messages through the mesh network.

- Each node can send or receive messages independently.
- Messages hop from node to node until they reach their destination.
- The software shows a map or list of connected nodes and signal strengths.

Use this feature to monitor your nodes remotely or send commands through the network.

## 💡 Tips for Success

- Keep your solar panel clean and exposed to sunlight.
- Regularly check battery voltage in the software to ensure good health.
- Place nodes within range of at least one other node to maintain mesh communication.
- Update your software often by checking the release page above.
- Use the included documentation for advanced setup if you want to customize more.
